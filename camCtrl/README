# camCtrl software 
#
# The main purpose of this software is to capture image stacks from Vimba GigE cameras
# over internet for creating HDR data with varying lighting conditions. 
# The software captures predefined number of images in a sequence with given exposure-
# times. 
# 
# There are several possibilities for naming the folders for images and also 
# several methods are offered for capture. However, only the basic stack capture
# is tested and have some reliablity...
#
# For processing a stack of images please see the processHDR program.

# Instructions to build
#
# For checking and installing dependencies please run as reqular user:
./chk_AVT_sdk
#
# And as root (or sudo): 
./chk_deps
#
#
# If all dependencies are correlctly set (or corrected in Makefile) one can 
# build the binary by invoking make. The binary file is created for x86 or x64 
# depending on the build platform. The resulting binary is located under bin/ 
# directory. Also the required vimba binaries are copied in the output folder. 
make
#
# To removes all build files - including the created binary invoke make clean
#make clean
#
#For doxygen generated source documentation (doxygen is not checked as 
# dependency) please invoke make with mydoc option and the documentation should
#be created at doc/html. For changing output please modify doc/config settings.
make mydoc

###################################
# 
# The program uses setup.ini for initialization of image capturing parameters. 
# The parameters should be selfexplanatory - if not please read the source code. 
#
# The program was written for multiple cameras but without parallel threads so 
# either FIX the code or be very cauntious when using multiple cameras (not tested)
#
# PROBLEM SOLVING:
#
# If you have problems running the software, especially you encounter 
# "CamCtrlVmbAPI::Init : VIMBA sytem startup failed : -16" - error please verify
# that you have installed the drivers correctly and the person invoking the program
# has the privileges to use the drivers. An easy fix is to copy the ".cti-file"
# (TransportLayer) to the same directory as the binary... 
#
# Also make sure that program has writing permission to the output folder.
