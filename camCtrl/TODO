# Merge the processHDR stack handling with the image capture:
# -now full stack of images is saved per capture as LZW-compressed 32-bit tiffs.
#  This requires up to 40 MB of space per stack (10 min interval -> 5.8GB/day). 
# -may be reduced to 0.28GB/day if only the compiled stack is saved.

## 2
# Change sumImage to one from processHDR stack (using exptime weighting)
